## About Bring It!

Bring It! is a web application that allows anyone to list and order their groceries from any grocery store of your choice near you.

This program is convenient for the elderly and disabled who are physically or mentally struggling to buy groceries. Customers will not be troubled to go outside of their houses and fetch groceries, especially in these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic. With Bring It!, it has never been easier to buy groceries at the comfort and convenience of your own home. Anyone can now shop more safely, efficiently, and at ease.
